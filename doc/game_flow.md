## Game Flow

### Turn Order
- Based on FIFO (First In, First Out) joining order
- Example: If A, B, C join in that order, turns follow same sequence
- Late-joining players are added to end of turn order
- Players can join mid-game

### Turn Structure
1. Active player receives random image based on configuration
2. Drawing timer starts (configurable duration)
3. Other players must wait (configurable duration) before guessing
4. Guessing phase:
   - Players submit guesses in chat
   - Correct guesses:
     * Player receives notification
     * Points awarded based on speed
     * Player is locked out from further guessing
   - Wrong guesses:
     * Player notified
     * Can continue guessing until timer ends
5. Timer expiration:
   - Image revealed
   - Correct answer displayed
   - Turn ends

### Scoring System
- Points awarded based on guessing speed
- Only first correct guess per player counts
- No points for incorrect guesses

### Round Structure
- Configurable number of rounds
- Each round consists of configurable number of turn cycles
- Example: 2 rounds Ã— 3 turns = 6 total turns per player

### Game End
- Occurs when all configured rounds are completed
- Final scores displayed
- Winner determined by total points
